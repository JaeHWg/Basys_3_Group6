Basys 3 Logic 1
B3 Logic:
 
B3 Logic Test Bench:
  





Basys_logic.v 
Contains our source code for the Boolean expression y = a AND b OR c. This file has 3 switches as input which represents a,b and c. It has a singular output y which is represented by an LED on the Basys 3. 
Basys_logic_tb.v
Contains our test bench code which calls the Basys_logic.v source code and tests the different combinations of a,b and c and the following output y. 
Challenges and Lesson Learnt:
We were not familiar with GitHub and the Verilog programming as it was a new language to us. We were also not entirely sure about the syntax we needed to sequence the necessary steps for the source code and the steps for test bench. Some of us also had some Vivado issues where the program has missing files or directory and we were not able to upload our source code into the Basys 3. 
After checking with the Professors and TAs, we were able to sequence our code and syntax properly following the Boolean expression y = a AND b OR c. We then managed to understand the different steps needed for the test bench to work and verify the functionality of our source code.
